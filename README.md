# Website for Steve Bacher - Progressive Democrat - Candidate for Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District

https://www.stevebacher.com/


The site is built with the following technologies:

- [Hugo Static Site Generator](http://gohugo.io/), which makes the site rock-solid secure and performant.
- Webpack to manage the asset pipeline.
- Tachyons CSS library.
- LazySizes JS library.

The site is open source and we will soon be extracting the site's layouts into a reusable theme. If you wish to take the code, please do, but please respect that the site's content belongs to its owner. More to follow.
