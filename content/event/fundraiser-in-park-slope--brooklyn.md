Please join us for a fundraiser brunch to support the candidacy of Steve Bacher, running for the House seat in Pennsylvania's 1st district (Southeastern PA). Steve is reaching out to Progressives in Brooklyn to gather support for his campaign. He will speak about a range of important issues and explain his motivation for running for Congress.

The fundraiser is in Park Slope on Sunday, March 25, from 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m.  The event address is provided upon registration.

Pennsylvania’s new 1st Congressional District is a swing district in the Philadelphia suburbs with a vulnerable freshman Republican incumbent.  Steve Bacher is a true progressive who has been working with the Democratic Party, the Climate Reality Project and 350.org in the district for a decade.  He served at HUD in the Clinton-Gore Administration and has dedicated his life to public service through nonprofits and community college education.

He is passionate about all the issues progressives care about:  equal rights for women and the LGBT community, gun safety, Medicare for All, living wages, immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and more.

As New Yorkers with relatively safe Democratic Congressional representatives, we are in a unique position to help elect a Democratic majority in 2018 by supporting progressive Democrats in flippable districts such as PA-01.
