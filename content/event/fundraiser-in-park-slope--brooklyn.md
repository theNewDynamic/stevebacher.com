Please join us for a fundraiser brunch to support the candidacy of Steve Bacher, running for the House seat in Pennsylvania's 1st district (Southeastern PA). Steve is reaching out to Progressives in our area to gather support for his campaign. Steve will speak about a range of important issues and explain his motivation for running for Congress.
