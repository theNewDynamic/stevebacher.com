Steve is pleased to participate in a forum about the environment with the Congressional candidates in the PA-01 district. 

This is a free, public event. Candidates will answer three questions, one each from the following 3 topics:   
1) Climate Change   
2) Public Lands  
3) Fossil Fuel / Alternative Energy. 

Preselected environmental questions (on the federal level) will be entertained as time permits from attendees, to be selected by the Bucks Environmental Action Event Organizing Committee.
