Steve is pleased to participate in a forum about the environment with the Congressional candidates in PA01. 

This is a free, public event where candidates for the 1st Congressional District of PA will answer three questions, one from each topic of: 1) Climate Change, 2) Public Lands, and 3) Fossil Fuel / Alternative Energy. Preselected environmental questions (on the federal level) will be entertained, as time permits, from attendees to be selected by the Bucks Environmental Action Event Organizing Committee.
