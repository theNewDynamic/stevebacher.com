Treatment and prevention programs must be fully funded as proposed by experts. Although Congressman Fitzpatrick has helped increase the issueâ€™s visibility, his party seeks to cut, not increase, treatment and prevention programs.

In order to combat the Opioid crisis in our community we must ensure that treatment is affordable and accessible to all who need it, and we must invest in evidence-based prevention programs to educate and insulate our young people.
