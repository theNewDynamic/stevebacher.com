I support Federal legislation which would require all states to have a fair, non-gerrymandered redistricting process starting after the 2020 census.  Following is the proposal as described by fairdistrictspa.com, adapted to apply to all states:

Redistricting will next happen after the 2020 census—which means the time is now to put fair redistricting standards into place.

The key change we advocate: **Appoint an impartial, independent citizens commission** to direct the process—not politicians drawing their own district lines. States that have put citizen commissions in place have seen improvements in representation, competitiveness, and voter trust.

  
 Create an independent citizens commission in charge of both legislative and congressional redistricting. The commission would include 11 members, selected at random by each state’s Secretary of State from three pools of qualified candidates:

* 4 members who are registered with one of the largest two political parties
* 4 members who are registered with the other of the largest two political parties
* 3 members who are unaffiliated or registered with a minority party

The commission would be:

* **Independent:** No current or recent elected officials, candidates, political party officials, or their aides or spouses would be eligible. Legislative leaders from both houses and parties would be able to strike a designated number of candidates from each pool.
* **Transparent:** The commission would establish transparent procedures, follow a strict timetable, and provide meaningful opportunity for public input prior to drawing plans and again before adopting final plans. All information would be available on a publicly accessible website.
* **Impartial and ethically bound**: When developing new district boundaries, the      commission would not be allowed to consider prior election results, the party affiliations of registered voters, or the addresses of incumbents or any other individuals.

This commission would be responsible for developing all district maps. Approval of a final plan would then require:

* At least seven votes
* At least one vote from each of the three groups

Once approved by the commission, the new district maps would not be subject to approval by state legislatures or governors, but any citizen could appeal the maps directly to state Supreme Courts.
