description: Who a person loves is  up to them.  What gender a person identifies as
  or chooses not to identify is up to them.  Our government should support equal rights
  for everyone regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

No one should be denied equal opportunity for housing, employment, healthcare  or serving our country based on their sexual orientation of gender choices. No LGBT person should be denied public accommodations. 

We need better training of police forces to help prosecute and prevent hate crimes. Some District Attorneys need training too.  I will work to make sure funding for this kind of training is in the Justice Department budget. 

Denying Lesbian and Gay couples the right to marry is unconstitutional. Congress should pass law confirming this standard in case  the Supreme court ever reverses itself. Love is Love is Love is Love.

I will introduce a new Equal Rights Amendment - 

1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.  
2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.  

  
HIV has never been a disease just in the gay community, but discrimination based on HIV status is often used as a proxy to discriminate against gay people.  HIV is a disease that should be treated based on sound medical standards.  No one should be discriminated against due to HIV status.
