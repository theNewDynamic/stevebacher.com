**Living Wage**: Our national minimum wage should be increased and regionally adjusted so that a family of four with one wage-earner working full-time at minimum wage can stay out of poverty.  The minimum wage should automatically be adjusted annually to keep up with inflation.  This starts with the Fight for $15 but does not end there.  In some parts of the country, a living wage is more than $15.  

The National Low Income Housing Coalition has a [calculator](http://nlihc.org/oor/ "calculator") that shows the minimum wage necessary for a family to rent a two-bedroom apartment and have their housing cost be no more than 30% of their income.  In Pennsylvania the average is more than $18.  Here in our district, some areas are even higher.  You would have to work 103 hours/week at the current minimum wage to afford a two-bedroom apartment, on average, in PA. 

**Infrastructure**:  President Trump, Paul Ryan and Brian Fitzpatrick promised a jobs bill to rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, power grid and other infrastructure. Where is it?  I would work to write and pass such a bill.

**Renewable Energy Jobs**:  The transition to renewable energy will create millions of well-paying, long-term jobs.  We must end subsidies for fossil fuels and make way for renewable energy, which is good for the economy and our planet.  There are already more than 4,000 renewable energy jobs in our district, more than in the fossil fuel industry.  This is a boom waiting to happen, if only we will stop subsidizing the already-profitable fossil fuel industry -- which is destroying our planet for our children and grandchildren.
