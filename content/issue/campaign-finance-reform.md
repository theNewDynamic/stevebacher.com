We need to get big money out of elections.

We need publicly financed election campaigns.

We need a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United.

Corporations are not people.  They should not have the same rights as people.

The right to contribute money in elections should be tied to the right to vote, not the right to speak.

I support a Constitutional Amendment such as that proposed by the organization Move to Amend.  As that organization states:

"We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in _Citizens United_ and other related cases, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that **money is not speech**, and that **human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights**."  

Here is the amendment as proposed by Move to Amend:

**Section 1. _\[Artificial Entities Such as Corporations Do Not Have Constitutional Rights\]_**

The rights protected by the Constitution of the United States are the rights of [natural persons](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# '"Natural persons" are living human beings only, as opposed to "artificial persons," a legal designation assigned to chartered entities that exist only in law, such as corporations.') only.

[Artificial entities](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "Artificial entities are entities chartered under state or federal law, including public and privately held corporations, LLCs, LLPs, PCs, nonprofit corporations and other corporations. Include any organization created by the law.") established by the laws of any State, the United States, or any foreign state shall have [no rights](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# 'This refers to "no rights" under the U.S. Constitution only.  Artificial entities operate under charter from the state in which they incorporate, and that charter grants them other "rights" under state law which are really privileges because they are not inalienable. In other words, they can be removed if state law is amended through the legislative process to change the privileges that govern business activities.') under this Constitution and are subject to [regulation](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "A rule or law created by governmental bodies designed to proscribe the limits or forms of behavior in specific circustances, both for individuals (i.e., wearing seatbelts) and entities (i.e., carbon sequestration).") by the People, through Federal, State, or local law.

The [privileges](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "A rule or law created by governmental bodies designed to proscribe the limits or forms of behavior in specific circumstances, both for individuals (i.e., wearing seatbelts) and entities (i.e., carbon sequestration).") of artificial entities shall be determined by the People, through Federal, State, or local law, and shall not be construed to be [inherent or inalienable](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "Rights that exist simply because you are a living human being; some would say rights given by God (or your Creator) rather than by government.").

**Section 2. _\[Money is Not Free Speech\]_**

Federal, State, and local government [shall](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# '"Shall" is a legal requirement or mandate. There is no other option or choice. It directs or authorizes by those who wrote and promoted the amendment. "May" is fuzzy. It shifts authority away from the amendment’s original architects to those who will interpret the language. "May" defers our power to decide. "May" in many cases, thus, can become "may not."') regulate, limit, or prohibit contributions and expenditures, including [a candidate's own contributions and expenditures](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "Because the Supreme Court ruled that money equals speech, candidates for elected office are permitted to spend personal fortunes to get themselves elected.  For example, NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent $109 million to get reelected in 2009.  How can anyone compete?"), to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their economic status, have access to the political process, and that no person gains, as a result of their money, substantially more access or ability to influence in any way the election of any candidate for public office or any [ballot measure](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "When a question is put on the ballot for a vote by the general public.  Typically, a large number of signatures from registered voters must be collected before a measure is put on the ballot.").

Federal, State, and local government [shall require](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# '"Shall" is a legal requirement or mandate. There is no other option or choice. It directs or authorizes by those who wrote and promoted the amendment. "May" is fuzzy. It shifts authority away from the amendment’s original architects to those who will interpret the language. "May" defers our power to decide. "May" in many cases, thus, can become "may not."') that any permissible contributions and expenditures be [publicly disclosed](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "Public disclosure of all campaign spending will make politicians own up to the realities of apparent or perceived corruption because the public will know who contributed the funds to get them elected. Including a Constitutional basis for disclosure will strengthen existing disclosure laws and allow for additional laws at the federal, state, and local level to ensure that the public knows the source of campaign funds and donors.").

The judiciary [shall not](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# '"Shall" is a legal requirement or mandate. There is no other option or choice. It directs or authorizes by those who wrote and promoted the amendment. "May" is fuzzy. It shifts authority away from the amendment’s original architects to those who will interpret the language. "May" defers our power to decide. "May" in many cases, thus, can become "may not."') construe the spending of money to influence elections to be [speech under the First Amendment](https://movetoamend.org/wethepeopleamendment# "The idea that money = speech was invented by the Supreme Court in 1976 in the case of Buckley v. Valeo.  The Court held that it was a violation of First Amendment freedom of speech to set overall campaign expenditure limits and to bar candidates from spending their own wealth to get themselves elected.
