  in all parts of our society, and their reproductive choices are essential to their
  lives.

* I'm proud to call myself a feminist, as feminism is the radical notion that women are people.  We as a society are wasting half our talent as women are kept from achieving their potential in media, academia, business and our armed forces, because of sexism in its many forms, including harassment by bosses, coworkers and venture capitalists.  I want my daughter and your daughters to have all the choices my son and your sons have.
* Essential to women's ability to control their lives is control of their reproductive health.  Birth control should be covered for all women.  Abortion, is a right, not a crime, essential to women's health and future.   For my fellow Americans who don't agree with me about abortion, the last thing you should do is defund Planned Parenthood, because the best way to prevent abortion is to provide age appropriate science based sex education for all our kids, and free or cheap access to birth control. Planned Parenthood provides both.
