We need sentencing reform to end the warehousing of nonviolent criminals.

We must return the goal of our prison system to rehabilitation, not simply punishment.

We must end for-profit prisons – no one should be making a profit from our nation’s highest-in-the-world rate of incarceration.  The government should run prisons on a not-for-profit basis, with employees earning reasonable wages.

According to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers):

"According to the ACLU’s original analysis, marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simply having marijuana. Nationwide, the arrest data revealed one consistent trend: significant racial bias. Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana."
