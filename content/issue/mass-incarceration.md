* We need sentencing reform to end the warehousing of nonviolent criminals.
* We must return the goal of our prison system to rehabilitation, not simply punishment.
* We must end for-profit prisons – no one should be making a profit from our nation’s highest-in-the-world rate of incarceration.  The government should run prisons on a not-for-profit basis, with employees earning reasonable wages.
