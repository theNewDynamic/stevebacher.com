**I support the bipartisan proposal of the Citizens Climate Lobby to create a Carbon Dividend** which would gradually increase the price of fossil fuels and give a dividend back to each American citizen each month.  This would use the market to predictably transition our economy to 100% clean energy, creating millions of new jobs.  This approach, also called “putting a price on carbon,” has been endorsed by Republicans including Christine Todd Whitman and George Shultz, as well as numerous Democrats.

All subsidies and other tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry should be abolished.

The Federal government should set aggressive deadlines for transitioning all government facilities, including the military, to 100% renewable energy (except for rare exceptions for select military necessities).

I support a ban on Federal approvals for new fossil fuel infrastructure, such as pipelines.

The Environmental Protection Agency should be fully funded to enable the thorough and efficient enforcement of the Clean Air Act, The Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and other environmental protections that keep our air, water and soil free from poisons.

Fracking is poisoning our water, air and soil. I support a ban on new fracking wells. Enacting the Climate Dividend proposal would force an orderly, predicable end to fracking as the price of natural gas rises.
