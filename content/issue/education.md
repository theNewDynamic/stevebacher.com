**We need to invest in our children, starting with pre-school.**  Children who attend quality pre-schools are more likely to excel in their education and careers, and less likely to need public assistance or end up incarcerated.

K-12 Education needs to be freed from the unintended consequences of No Child Left Behind:  an over-emphasis on testing.  Public elementary schools need to be allowed to return to instilling a love of learning while teaching the basics.  Elementary school should not be a stressful, test-driven environment.  Children should be taught creative thinking, so they can become the problem-solvers of tomorrow.  Linking teacher salaries to test scores has led to a degradation of our entire educational system, and it must stop.

Post-secondary vocational training, community colleges and public colleges and universities should be offered debt-free.
