* Respect for immigrants – Most citizens of the U.S. are immigrants or descended from immigrants.  My grandfather and great-grandparents were immigrants.  I aim to treat all immigrants and their children as I would want my grandparents to be treated:  with respect and dignity. 
* Refugees and new immigrants – Our nation is a beacon of hope throughout the world.  We must keep our doors open to asylum-seekers whose homes have been ravaged by war or famine.  Generation after generation, refugees become productive American citizens who strengthen our society.  We must create policies that support keeping families together and reuniting family members who have been separated by tragedy.
* “Dreamers” – Law-abiding people who were brought here illegally as children should be given a path to citizenship.  They have done nothing wrong as adults.  The House passed such a bill several years ago, and a majority approved it in the Senate – however, a 60-vote supermajority was not achieved.  This legislation should be re-introduced and passed.
