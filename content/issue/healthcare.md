The Republicans promised to make health insurance less expensive and cover more people.  Instead, they tried to take away health care from 23 million Americans.

**Single Payer, or Medicare for All, would provide health insurance coverage for everyone**, at a lower cost than our current system.  Single Payer means the government provides not-for-profit health insurance for everyone.  All doctors and hospitals are “in network.”  Working people pay premiums, which are less expensive than current premiums, because no one is making a profit, there are no high paid CEOs, and there is no need for advertising.  Employers would no longer be part of the health insurance system, relieving business owners, large and small, of the regulatory and financial burden of health insurance.  Employees could change jobs with zero impact on their health insurance.

**Medicare and Medicaid** will be fully funded throughout to provide services including mental health care and drug addiction treatment for the full length of time they are needed by each individual patient.

**Under both HR 676 and S1804, the two Medicare for All bills in the House and Senate,** employers would pay part of the cost, as they do now for Medicare/Medicaid. Like individuals, that cost would be way less than the premiums they pay now and, most importantly, it would be uniform and while it might increase with the size of the business over time, it would never impose annual double-digit rises, as ACA and private insurance does. No one can say what the final rate would be, but both bills favor a sliding scale starting at matching the individual rate of 4.75%. Also important for business is the fact that they won't have to pay worker's comp medical costs.
