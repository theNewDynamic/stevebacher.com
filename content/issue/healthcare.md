The Republicans promised to make health insurance less expensive and cover more people.  Instead, they tried to take away health care from 23 million Americans.

**Single Payer, or Expanded Medicare for All, would provide health insurance coverage for everyone**, at a lower cost than our current system.  Single Payer means the government provides not-for-profit health insurance for everyone.  All doctors and hospitals are “in network.”  Working people pay premiums, a percentage of wages, which are less expensive than current premiums, because no one is making a profit, there are no high paid CEOs, and there is no need for advertising.  As with Social Security, employers also pay a percentage of wages as premiums.  There are no co-pays or deductibles.  There is no need for "gap" insurance, because everything is included (except elective surgeries such as cosmetic surgery).  Employers no longer provide insurance, self-insure or have to expend resources shopping for health insurance plans and administering them.  Business owners, large and small, are relieved of the regulatory and financial burden of health insurance.  Employees could change jobs or choose to work for themselves with zero impact on their health insurance.

**Medicare and Medicaid** will be fully funded throughout to provide services including mental health care and drug addiction treatment for the full length of time they are needed by each individual patient.

**Under both HR 676 and S1804, the two Medicare for All bills in the House and Senate,** employers would pay part of the cost, as they do now for Medicare/Medicaid. Like individuals, that cost would be way less than the premiums they pay now and, most importantly, it would be uniform and while it might increase with the size of the business over time, it would never impose annual double-digit rises, as ACA and private insurance does. No one can say what the final rate would be, but both bills favor a sliding scale starting at matching the individual rate of 4.75%. Also important for business is the fact that they won't have to pay worker's comp medical costs.
