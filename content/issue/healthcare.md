The Republicans promised to make health insurance less expensive and cover more people.  Instead, they tried to take away health care from 23 million Americans.

**Single Payer, or Medicare for All, would provide health insurance coverage for everyone**, at a lower cost than our current system.  Single Payer means the government provides not-for-profit health insurance for everyone.  All doctors and hospitals are “in network.”  Working people pay premiums, which are less expensive than current premiums, because no one is making a profit, there are no high paid CEOs, and there is no need for advertising.  Employers would no longer be part of the health insurance system, relieving business owners, large and small, of the regulatory and financial burden of health insurance.  Employees could change jobs with zero impact on their health insurance.

**Medicare and Medicaid** must be fully funded to provide services including mental health care and drug addiction treatment for the full length of time they are needed by each individual patient.
