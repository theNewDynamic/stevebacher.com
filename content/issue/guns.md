Along with the vast majority of Americans, I support, and will fight for:

* **background checks** for _all_ gun sales including private sales and trades between individuals,
* restricting **military-style weapons**, such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and devices which turn non-automatics into automatics or semi-automatics, such as bump stocks, to use by the military and the police only,
* **banning high capacity magazines**
* preventing **convicted domestic abusers** from possessing guns,
* creating a system to fairly identify and exclude people with **serious mental illnesses** from obtaining guns,
* **banning silencers,**
* **banning online sales of guns and ammunition,**
* making **gun licenses** more like automobile drivers licenses, with required education and testing in the safe use and storage of guns and ammunition;
* raising the **minimum age for buying a gun to 21,**
* creating a **waiting period of at least three days** between the request for a permit to buy, which initiates a background check, and the purchase, and
* **repealing gun manufacturer liability immunity.**

I'm open to suggestions from experts for additional legislation that would reduce the loss of life.
