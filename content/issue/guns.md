Along with the vast majority of Americans, I support, and will fight for:

* **background checks** for _all_ gun sales including private sales and trades between individuals,
* restoring the assault weapons ban, restricting **military-style weapons**, such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons, to use by the military and the police only,
* **banning bumpstocks** and any other devices which turn non-automatics into automatics or semi-automatics,
* **banning high capacity magazines**
* **banning silencers,**
* **banning online sales of guns and ammunition,**
* preventing **convicted domestic abusers** from possessing guns,
* closing the “boyfriend loophole” to prevent unmarried partners charged with violent felonies from possessing weapons.
* creating a system to fairly identify and exclude people with **serious mental illnesses** from obtaining guns,
* making **gun licenses** more like automobile drivers licenses, with required education and testing in the safe use and storage of guns and ammunition, and required insurance;
* raising the **minimum age for buying a gun to 21,**
* creating a **waiting period of at least three days** between the request for a permit to buy, which initiates a background check, and the purchase, and
* **repealing gun manufacturer liability immunity,**
* **restoring funding** and authorization for the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence as a health issue.

I'm open to suggestions from experts for additional legislation that would reduce the loss of life.

We don't have to start from scratch.  There are already [many pieces of legislation awaiting action in Congress](https://blumenauer.house.gov/sites/blumenauer.house.gov/files/2018-02-14%20Gun%20Legislation%20.pdf).  

Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America has a great web page that debunks gun myths:  [https://momsdemandaction.org/campaigns/debunking-gun-myths/](https://momsdemandaction.org/campaigns/debunking-gun-myths/ "https://momsdemandaction.org/campaigns/debunking-gun-myths/")
