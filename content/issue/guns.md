Along with the vast majority of Americans, I support universal background checks, preventing convicted domestic abusers from obtaining guns, creating a system to fairly identify and exclude people with serious mental illnesses from obtaining guns, and restricting military-style weapons, such as automatic weapons and devices which turn non-automatics into automatics, to use by the military and the police only.  This includes restricting the sale of ammunition for automatic weapons to the military and the police.  Gun licenses should be made more like automobile drivers licenses, with required education in the safe use and storage of guns and ammunition.
