Along with the vast majority of Americans, I support, and will fight for:

* **background checks** for _all_ gun sales including private sales and trades between individuals, 
* preventing **convicted domestic abusers** from possessing guns, 
* creating a system to fairly identify and exclude people with **serious mental illnesses** from obtaining guns, 
* restricting **military-style weapons**, such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and devices which turn non-automatics into automatics or semi-automatics, such as bump stocks, to use by the military and the police only,
* **restricting the sale of all ammunition** to civilians to small quantities, and restricting ammunition for automatic and semi-automatic weapons to the military and the police.Â  
* **banning silencers** 
* **banning high capacity magazines** 
* **banning online sales of guns and ammunition.**  
* **Gun licenses** should be made more like automobile drivers licenses, with required education and testing in the safe use and storage of guns and ammunition; mental health screening should be required as well.
* The **minimum age for buying a gun should be 21,** 
* there should be a **waiting period of at least three days** between the request for a permit to buy, which initiates a background check, and the purchase.  

I'm open to suggestions from experts for additional legislation that would reduce the loss of life.
