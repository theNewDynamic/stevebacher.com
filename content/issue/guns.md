Along with the vast majority of Americans, I support background checks for _all_ gun sales including private sales and trades between individuals, preventing convicted domestic abusers from possessing guns, creating a system to fairly identify and exclude people with serious mental illnesses from obtaining guns, and restricting military-style weapons, such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and devices which turn non-automatics into automatics or semi-automatics, to use by the military and the police only.  This includes restricting the sale of all ammunition to civilians to small quantities, and restricting ammunition for automatic and semi-automatic weapons to the military and the police.  Gun licenses should be made more like automobile drivers licenses, with required education and testing in the safe use and storage of guns and ammunition; mental health screening should be required as well.

The minimum age for buying a gun should be 21, and there should be a waiting period of at least three days between the request for a permit to buy, which initiates a background check, and the purchase.  Internet sales of weapons and ammunition should also be banned.

I'm open to suggestions from experts for additional legislation that would reduce the loss of life.
