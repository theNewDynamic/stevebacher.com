I support strengthening labor unions.

Labor unions have worked to make all workplaces safer, all wages higher, and all jobs more family-friendly throughout our history.  

Union jobs have been key to creating and continue to be essential to sustaining an American middle class.

We must continue to fight for paid family leave, better public transportation, affordable high-quality child care and other necessities to make working life family-friendly.

The fact that wages are stagnant in the United States is no accident.  Big corporations have been waging a war against unions and all workers for decades.  Stronger unions mean better wages, better benefits and safer workplaces for all.

Without unions, we would still have child labor, a six-day work week and much more dangerous workplaces.
