Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, and Sens. Toomey and Casey should join other members of Congress and pass the TRUMP Act immediately, unanimously.  
  
The TRUMP Act is simple:  
**Section 1.** All candidates for federal office, including Congress and president, shall provide their federal tax returns for the previous five years to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) within 24 hours of the submission of petitions for a candidate to be on a ballot.  
  
**Section 2.** All individuals nominated to serve as federal judges or executive branch cabinet secretaries shall provide their federal tax returns for the previous five years to the Department of Justice (DOJ) within seven days of a candidate’s nomination, and at least 30 days prior to their confirmation.  
  
**Section 3.** All incumbent holders of the federal positions referred to in Section 1 and Section 2 shall provide their federal tax returns for the previous five years to the FEC and DOJ respectively within 30 days of the passage of this bill into law.  
  
**Section 4.** The FEC and DOJ shall redact Social Security numbers, home addresses and phone numbers, and make the redacted documents referred to in Sections 1 through 3 available to the public for free within 24 hours via publication as PDF documents on a state-of-the-art website or similar successor technology.  
  
**Section 5.** No exceptions shall be made for federal tax returns that are in the process of being audited.  
  
**Section 6.** No exceptions shall be made for any reason.  
  
**Section 7.** “Federal tax returns” shall be defined as all federal tax return forms, schedules and other documents as submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or any successor agency.  
  
**Section 8.** The provisions of this bill shall become effective immediately upon passage. You can name this bill anything you want. I’m taking the name from a similar bill proposed by a New York state senator; that bill only applies to the presidency and New York State. I also call my proposed legislation the Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act, or for short, the TRUMP Act. I call upon my representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to introduce or co-sponsor and pass this bill into law immediately.
