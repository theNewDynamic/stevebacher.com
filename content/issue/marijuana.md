Marijuana should be treated like alcohol.  It should be regulated to ensure that it is not laced with dangerous additives, and it should be sold by licensed proprietors rather than on the black market.  Taking these steps would limit youth access to marijuana by shrinking the black market, generate tax revenues to fund our communities, and save tax dollars currently used to arrest and prosecute people for possession.

In addition, early studies indicate that states where marijuana is legal have lower incidence of opioid abuse.

According to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/gallery/marijuana-arrests-numbers):

"According to the ACLU’s original analysis, marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simply having marijuana. Nationwide, the arrest data revealed one consistent trend: significant racial bias. Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana."
