Marijuana should be treated like alcohol.  It should be regulated to ensure that it is not laced with dangerous additives, and it should be sold by licensed proprietors rather than on the black market.  Taking these steps would limit access to our youth, generate tax revenues to fund our communities, and save tax dollars currently used to necessarily arrest and prosecute people for possession.
