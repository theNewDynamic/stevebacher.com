Marijuana should be treated like alcohol. It should be regulated so it is safe and not laced with other things, distributed through specially-licensed retail outlets (like liquor stores), with age restrictions and taxes collected. Making marijuana available legally will reduce connections between youth and black market sellers, who would introduce users to other drugs as well.
