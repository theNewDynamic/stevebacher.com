My daughter was born with part of her left hand missing.  Our family are active participants in and supporters of Camp No Limits, a nonprofit organization that creates camps across the United States for children with limb loss or limb differences, and their families.

I support full funding for Medicaid and other government programs that provide services for people who experience disabilities.  There should be no waiting lists for services.  

I support expanding Medicaid funding, so that the hard-working people who provide services for people who experience disabilities can earn living wages and not have to work second jobs or depend on government subsidies to stay out of poverty.

I support the Disability Integration Act, which states that disability rights are civil rights.
