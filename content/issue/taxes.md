People who make a million dollars or more every year need to pay their fair share.  “Trickle down,” giving tax breaks to the wealthiest because they are “job creators” doesn’t work.  It didn’t work in the Reagan era, it didn’t work under George W. Bush.  We have had the greatest prosperity during the Eisenhower, Johnson and Clinton Administrations, when millionaires paid their fair share and the middle class and working poor paid less in taxes.  When middle class and working poor people have more money in our pockets, we spend it, supporting businesses large and small, leading to the creation of more jobs.  We the people are the true job creators.
