Where is the outrage? Where is the leadership?

Congressman-elect Brian Fitzpatrick is missing in action. Since the election he has issued no statement on the upsurge in hate crimes in his district and the nation. No statement regarding the nomination of white supremacist Steve Bannon as senior advisor to the president-elect. No statement regarding the nomination of climate change denier Scott Pruitt to be director of the Environmental Protection Agency. No statement regarding the nomination of anti-public schools advocate Elisabeth DeVos to head the Department of Education. There are too many more outrageous appointments to list here.

Fitzpatrick did not disassociate himself from Trump for most of the campaign, despite Trump calling climate change a hoax, despite his scapegoating Muslims, despite his racism and sexism, his disdainful treatment of so many women, his disrespect for the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, etc., etc. Then, after the Access Hollywood tape was released, in which Trump confessed to sexual assault, then and only then, in October 2016, did Fitzpatrick announce he wouldn't support Trump for president.

Where do you stand now, Mr. Fitzpatrick? Where is your leadership? Where is your outrage?

What does the former FBI counter-terrorism agent turned congressman-elect think about the president-elect's dismissal of the FBI and CIA's conclusion that the Russians conspired to swing the election to Trump? What does he think of the president-elect's rejection of their conclusions, and his insults to the agencies?

What does he think of Trump's procrastination of cutting ties with his business, and refusal to let the American public know about any conflicts of interest that might be revealed by his tax returns?

Fitzpatrick's website is silent. His Facebook and Twitter feeds acknowledge Veterans Day and Thanksgiving, but as of Dec. 20, there was nothing about the presidential transition.

Silence, Mr. Fitzpatrick, is assent. For shame.
