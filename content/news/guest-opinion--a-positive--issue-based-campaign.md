We candidates in the Democratic congressional primary should talk about issues, not each other. I am running a positive, issue-based campaign. You can view detailed positions on more than a dozen issues at [https://www.stevebacher.com/issue](https://www.stevebacher.com/issue "https://www.stevebacher.com/issue").

For example, the Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal is featured prominently on my website. It is a specific, bipartisan proposal to put a fee on carbon emissions and send the money back to American households as a monthly dividend.  \[This would stimulate investment in renewable energy, creating well-paying jobs here and across the nation.\]

Fellow Democratic Party candidate Scott Wallace has said publicly that there’s “not much daylight” between us. Not true. My environment page addresses several facets of environmental policy on which my opponents are silent. For example, we should ban fracking, which poisons our water and air.

I support a living wage that is regionally adjusted to reflect housing and other costs — in Pennsylvania the average would be more than $18. Wallace supports $15; Reddick lacks specifics.

I support a true 100 percent not-for-profit, single-payer health insurance system. Wallace advocates for one that, “significantly reduces (but does not eliminate) the role of private insurance companies.” Reddick talks about “expanding access” without advocating for Medicare-for-all.

I support legalizing marijuana for recreational and medicinal use. The other candidates don’t address this issue. A majority of American adults have used marijuana. Most have purchased it through someone with a connection to organized crime gangs.

It’s time to legalize it, regulate it, allow purchase through specially-licensed retail outlets like liquor stores and tax it.

Legalizing it will reduce the likelihood that users are exposed to other, more harmful drugs offered in the black market. Early studies are showing that places where marijuana is legal have lower incidence of opioid abuse.

Having worked at Bucks County Community College for eight years, I understand the need for free tuition for community colleges and public universities, and I advocate for it. For this and other reasons, I have been endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers Local 2238. As of this writing, no other candidate has been endorsed by a union.

There are more differences to be found by comparing our websites carefully. I am the only candidate who has been working for change in our district for the last decade. I ask for your support.
