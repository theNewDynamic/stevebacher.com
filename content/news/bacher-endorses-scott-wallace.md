Dear Friends,

Thank you so much for your support during our primary campaign.  

Together, we accomplished so much.  For years, I have been disappointed in the lack of attention to environmental protection issues in Congressional campaigns and in the media here in the first (formerly eighth) district, especially as regards climate change.

Thanks to our efforts, climate change and other environmental issues have been discussed at length in campaign forums, the debate at Bucks County Community College, and the environmental forum organized by Bucks Environmental Action.  

With your support, I also gave voice to the need for a true expanded Medicare for All, a minimum wage which is a living wage, a transition to renewable energy that will create well-paying jobs, and so much more.

We waged a positive, issue-focused campaign, and resisted the temptation to attack our opponents in ways that could be used against them in the general election.

I am proud of all of our work together, and grateful for your support, whether it was gathering petition signatures, door knocking, standing at the polls, sharing things on social media, writing postcards, phone banking or contributing financially.

Now it is time for us to unite to give Scott Wallace, Tom Wolf, Bob Casey, John Fetterman, Steve Santarsiero, Tina Davis, Maria Collett, my State Rep. Perry Warren and the other State Rep. candidates victory in the fall.  I urge you to stay involved, as I intend to, giving time and money until it hurts, to take back our Congress and State Legislature to enact a compassionate, progressive vision of our state and nation.

In Peace,

Steve Bacher
