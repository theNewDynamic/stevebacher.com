“It appears that the Bucks County Democratic Committee (BCDC) failed to learn the lessons of the 2016 election: that voters want a party run by the people, from the bottom up, not one run from the top down by big money. The Committee missed the opportunity to choose an open primary with no endorsement in this race.

“This morning’s vote does not serve the interests of the people who want to get big money out of politics; it does not serve the interests of people who are fighting to preserve the people’s voice in our democracy.

“I will continue to fight the good fight for the pro-democracy Democratic resistance, for equal rights for women and the LGBT community, for commonsense gun safety, for renewable energy and infrastructure jobs paid for by fair taxes on the wealthiest 1%, for living wages, and to stop climate change.

“We are the party of working families and the middle class, not the party of mega-millionaires and billionaires. The voters in our district are fed up with the top-down approach of both political parties. I have grassroots support and will win the primary and general elections by connecting with voters in a way only someone who has lived here can. I understand the struggles of the people in this district because I live and work in the district, my children go to school in the district, and I’ve been fighting to keep our air and water clean in our district. We struggle with stagnant wages, affordable health insurance and we want our schools and other public spaces to be safe. We’re ready to ban military weapons from civilian ownership, raise the age to purchase guns to 21, and pass more commonsense gun safety measures. We’re ready to separate health insurance from employment by passing Medicare for All. We’re ready to put a price on carbon pollution to create renewable energy jobs and stop climate change. We’re ready to raise taxes on the wealthiest one percent to pay for free public college and vocational training and to rebuild our roads and bridges.

“I will fight tirelessly against Brian Fitzpatrick’s complicit support for the Trump Administration’s war against our democracy, our young people and our future. We will grow the bottom-up movement that is needed to take on Fitzpatrick in the general election. Together we will rise up and take back this district for the hard-working, compassionate people who live and work here.

“I will continue to work for the support of the more than 80,000 likely Democratic primary voters and the hundreds of thousands of voters of all parties in the general election."
