_Lower Makefield, PA. — April 16, 2018._ Steve Bacher, Democratic Congressional candidate in Pennsylvania's new 1st district, will host a series of town hall-style Facebook Live meetings in the remaining weeks of the primary campaign. The events will begin at 8:00 p.m. and continue for at least 45 minutes, on Tuesday, April 17, Monday, April 23, Thursday, April 26, Sunday, April 29, Wednesday, May 2 and Sunday, May 6. The live stream video will be available on the [campaign's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SteveBacherForCongress/ "Steve Bacher for Congress"), and will be archived for viewing after the broadcast is over. 

“Brian Fitzpatrick has been inaccessible,” Bacher said. “If elected, I plan to have a live, face-to-face town hall in different parts of the district at least six times a year, as well as using new media such as Facebook Live to be accessible to as many constituents as possible. Brian Fitzpatrick gives no notice for his phone call town halls – I will always publicize events in advance. “It is important that our representatives be enthusiastic about meeting constituents, listening to their concerns and answering their questions. I will answer questions via Facebook Live in a series of six town hall-style events in the coming four weeks. I invite all Democratic primary voters to watch and ask me about the issues that are most important to them.”

Each live broadcast will begin with an opening statement, followed by an open question and answer period. Viewers can submit questions during the broadcast via Facebook comments.
