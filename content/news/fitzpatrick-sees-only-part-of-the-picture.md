Brian Fitzpatrick has bad judgment. The Republican congressional candidate early in his campaign supported Donald Trump despite Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax, despite his racist slurs against Mexicans, despite his bigoted proposal to ban all Muslims from immigrating to the U.S., despite his insults to Sen. John McCain and all Americans who have been prisoners of war. And despite his insults to the parents of an American soldier who heroically sacrificed himself in the service of his country.

Trump is a disgrace, and Brian Fitzpatrick stuck with him until a few weeks ago. What terrible judgment!

Trump's videotaped confession to sexually assaulting women finally pushed Brian Fitzpatrick to put country first -- but what was he waiting for all these months of Trump's other outrages?

Brian Fitzpatrick thinks the only threats to our country are military and terrorist threats. While these are real threats, Brian Fitzpatrick only sees part of the picture. He is blinded by Republican orthodoxy. His website doesn't contain the words "climate" or "environment." He apparently thinks by pretending these challenges don't exist, they will go away.

Climate change is the No. 1 long-term threat to our nation's security, according to the military, and the No. 1 threat to the world's economy, according to the World Economic Forum. Brian Fitzpatrick flaunts his career in the FBI, but he has his head in the sand about the threat of climate change: he stated in a primary debate regarding climate change that "the evidence is disputed," later saying that climate change is related to human activity. We need national leaders who recognize the immediate threat that climate change is, and will take action to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren.

Brian Fitzpatrick says he wants to make our families safe, but his website says nothing about common sense gun safety. It appears he is in the pocket of the NRA, like the rest of the Republican establishment.

Let's look at a sample of his biggest donors (see for yourself at OpenSecrets.org). Do you think he'll be tough on the big banks that crashed our economy? The American Bankers Association gave him $20,000.

Do you think he's really going to simplify our tax system? The American Institute of CPAs gave him $15,000.

Do you think he's going to protect our environment against big polluters? Dow Chemical gave him $10,000.

We need leaders who are willing to confront our nation's greatest challenges with vision, who are willing to listen to others across the partisan divide and forge compromises that move our nation forward. Steve Santarsiero authored bipartisan legislation that reformed Harrisburg's ethics regulations, and he will work with Republicans, Democrats and Independents to reform Washington as well. He has been a leader in protecting the Delaware River from the dangers of fracking pollution, and he will lead in forging climate solutions in Congress. He has been endorsed by the Sierra Club, Clean Water Action, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Democrat Steve Santarsiero has also been a leader in advocating for common sense gun safety legislation, such as closing background check loopholes, and keeping military-style weapons in the hands of the military and out of the hands of domestic violence perpetrators. He supports "no-fly, no-buy" legislation to keep guns out of the hands of potential terrorists who are on the government's "no-fly" lists -- common sense legislation that the Republican Congress refused to pass.

Steve Santarsiero supports health care for women, including funding Planned Parenthood, which provides needed services such as cancer screenings and gynecological exams to women across the country. Brian Fitzpatrick's bad judgment leads him to advocate de-funding these needed services. More Republican establishment orthodoxy.

Brian Fitzpatrick was flown in by the Republican establishment to take over his brother's seat in Congress. But you are too smart to be fooled. He supported Trump despite Trump's many foul statements and actions. He's in the pocket of Republican establishment orthodoxy on climate change, guns and more. He's in the pocket of big donors who stand in the way of progress on issues that are important to the people of Bucks County.

Don't be fooled again. Say no to bad judgement.

Say yes to a real leader, a bipartisan leader, an honest man with good judgement. Say yes to Steve Santarsiero for Congress on Nov. 8.
