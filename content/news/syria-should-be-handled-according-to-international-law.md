**SYRIA SHOULD BE HANDLED ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW** 

**Congress Should Hold Hearings and Vote on Use of Force** 

_Lower Makefield, PA, April 12, 2018_  – Steve Bacher, candidate for U.S. Congress in the new First Congressional District, comprised of all of Bucks County and part of Montgomery County, released the following statement regarding the Trump Administration’s public intention to use military force in response to alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria: 

Violence is a last resort, not a first resort. 

The United States Congress should take up its constitutional responsibility and have hearings and debate before force is used in Syria – or anywhere else in the world. The Trump Administration can make its case to Congress, but only Congress can declare war. 

The lawful course of action is an independent investigation under existing international law and treaties. 

If the investigation yields evidence of war crimes, the crimes should be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court, and tougher sanctions imposed. Any military action in Syria should be authorized in advance by Congress and executed in concert with our allies.
