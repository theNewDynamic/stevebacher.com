Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey should join the other members of Congress to introduce, co-sponsor and pass the TRUMP Act immediately.

The TRUMP (Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public) Act would require the Internal Revenue Service to disclose the federal income tax returns of candidates for federal elected office, nominees for federal judge and executive branch Cabinet secretaries, and incumbent officeholders. (I'm taking the name from a similar bill proposed by a New York state senator; that bill only applies to the presidency and New York State.)

Candidates for elected federal office would notify the IRS when they submit petitions to appear on ballots. This includes the president, senators and House members. Nominees for appointed office would do the same upon nomination. The IRS would have two weeks to post their federal income tax returns for the current and previous five years on a free, publicly accessible website.

The IRS would publish the returns of current holders of the same offices within 30 days of passage of the bill into law.

Social security numbers, phone numbers and addresses would be redacted. There would be no exceptions for audits or anything else.

Let's pass this with a veto-proof unanimous vote, please.
